.SH NAME
    int _printf(const char *format, ...)
    Prints a string to the screen, taking into account directives
    that format the string.

.SH SYNOPSIS
    Within a main function, _printf is used with no flags or options.
    directives can be used to format the string, and these include
    %c (character), %s (string), %d (decimal), and %i (integer).

    Necessary to the functioning of _printf are the following functions.
    print_number - returns the string representation of an integer.
    print_string - returns a string using print_char.
    str_len - returns the length of a string.
    count_digits - counts the number of digits in an integer.
    print_char - prints a single character.
.SH DESCRIPTION
    _printf returns the length of the string that was printed to the screen
    and can be used in a similar but limited manner to printf. See man printf.
.SH EXAMPLES
    Some examples include:
    _printf("My name is %s", "Jane");
    _printf("My middle initial is %c", 'B');
    _printf("I will be %d by my next birthday", 89);
    _printf("I have %i dogs", 3);
